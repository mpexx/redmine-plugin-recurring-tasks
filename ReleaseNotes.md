## Features Requested and Known Issues

Reference open issues in GitHub: https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks/issues

In work
* Clarify how recurrences are calculated for non-fixed ([#64](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks/issues/64))

Done
* Recurred issue start date is set to original offset as original issue, i.e. if the original issue was set to take one month to complete, the recurred issue will have the same timespan 
  ([#76](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks/issues/76))
* Display localized date in partial contributed by @guite ([#81](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks/issues/81))
* Assign the issue author based on a) configured recurring user, or b) previous issue author to avoid permissions issues conflict with Luxury Buttons plugin
